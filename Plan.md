# Plan

1. Expand the game model to multiplayer-ready sessions with humans and bots.
2. Add richer unit catalog (land/air/water classes) with economic costs and upkeep.
3. Implement strategic systems: groups, map templates, resource extraction, and A* pathfinding.
4. Add durability testing focused on multi-player action load, memory profile, network bytes, and unit counts.
5. Add offline simulation mode, update docs, and provide a deep AwanDB analysis report.
6. Improve combat simulation with collision handling, bullet drop behavior, and AoE damage registration.
